You may adjust the frequency of the requests to the BBDC server by changing the lower and upper bounds in lines 8-11. Do note that, if you attempt to query the server too fast, you may be suspended for 48 hours. If this happens, do not log in during the 48 hour period, otherwise the timer will reset.

Note that I (along with this software) am not affiliated, endorsed, or employed by BBDC, and excessive polling of the site may result in your account being temporarily/permanently suspended from the BBDC service.
